<p id="hrm7600" class="course-title">HRM7600 Global Human Resources Management</p>
    <p>Global Human Resources Management (GHRM) has been identified as a crucial factor in a firm’s international success. GHRM
        is more complex and varied than domestic HRM and incorporates a broader scope, and increased risk exposure as well
        as a change of emphasis. This course will examine environmental elements and the characteristics of GHRM. It will
deal with the practical issues and consequences of the internationalisation of HRM.</p>
<p id="mgnt7090" class="course-title">MGNT7090 Strategic Management and Business Policy</p>
    <p>This course is the study of strategic management. It is designed to integrate concepts from the functional disciplines
        that constitute a business curriculum. The scope of the course is broad and integrative with special emphasis placed
        on strategic analysis, formulation and implementation of business strategies at the business and corporate levels.
        In essence, strategic management is the systematic study of how firms can gain a competitive advantage and achieve
        consistent superior performance. The perspective taken in the course is that of a general manager – the owner, the
        CEO, or management consultant. The problems faced by general managers are complex and unstructured and every business
        decision is made with incomplete information. An attempt is made to replicate this ambiguous situation in a classroom
        environment to force students to make the best decisions given available information, with special emphasis on the
media industry.</p>
    <p id="mgnt7280" class="course-title">MGNT7280 Managing Change</p>
    <p>Managing change has become the norm in today’s turbulent business environment, and almost all organisations have faced
        large-scale changes. The current challenge, and the one addressed in this course, is to find ways to manage the change
        process more effectively. Using a case-based approach, we consider the common types of changes organisations pursue
        and what it means to manage those changes. The focus is on key, interrelated issues of when to change, how to enable
change, and reacting to change.</p>
<p id="mkt7070" class="course-title">MKT7070 Global Marketing Strategy</p>
    <p>The aim of this course is to give students an understanding of contemporary issues in global marketing and media management,
        with a special focus on practical problems involved. Issues in the context of the new business environment will be
identified and analyzed using global marketing theories.</p>
    <p id="mkt7100" class="course-title">MKT7100 Management of Marketing Communication and Online Media</p>
    <p>The aim of this course is to provide students with the knowledge and skills needed to analyse and solve marketing communication
        problems at a strategic level, taking into account both offline and online communication channels, and the impact
        on the firm as well as society in general.<br>
    </p>
<p id="mkt7130" class="course-title">MKT7130 Services Marketing Management</p>
    <p>Although firms have long recognised the value of services, most business programmes still focus on the marketing and
        management of physical products. This course addresses the importance of the services industry, and the distinctive
        characteristics of services. Students develop a firm understanding of key challenges and issues associated with marketing
        in a services environment, gain a broad understanding of the interaction between marketing and management in a service
organisation, and become familiar with issues in developing and assessing service quality.</p>
